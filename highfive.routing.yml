# In order to to create pages it is necessary to define routes for them. A route
# maps a URL path to a controller. It defines with what function or method will
# be called when a URL is accessed.

# Menu items corresponding to these URLs are defined separately in the
# highfive.menu_links.yml file.

# Example:
#   If the user accesses http://example.com/highfive/demo, the routing
#   system will look for a route the path of 'highfive/demo'.
#   In this case it will find a match, since we
#   define the highfive/demo path below on line 22.
#   Upon finding a path match, Drupal will execute the specified '_controller' callback (i.e. line 24).
#   In this case the callback is defined as a classname
#   "\Drupal\highfive\Controller\HighFiveController" and the method of the class
#   "tutorial". This is found in the file /src/Controller/HighFiveController.php

# Notice that the user must have the permission we define in highfive.permissions.yml
# That permission has the machine name of 'access highfive demo'. (i.e. line 27)

highfive.demo_route:
  path: '/highfive/demo'
  defaults:
    _controller: '\Drupal\highfive\Controller\HighFiveController::tutorial'
    _title: 'High Five Demonstration'
  requirements:
    _permission: 'access highfive demo'

# TODO: Task 5) Create a route for a page 'High Five Definition'
#               with the path of 'highfive/about'
#               and permission of 'access highfive about'



# TODO: Task 10) Create a route with arguments {first} and {second} which utilizes a page callback
#          which displays a simple message saying "{first} and {second} gave each other a high five!"
#          - Use the path of "highfive/{first}/{second}"
#          - Use permission of 'give highfives', which needs to be defined in highfive.permissions.yml
#          - See page_example.routing.yml of the Examples module for more details of dynamic routes.
